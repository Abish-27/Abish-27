## About me
I’m a Computer Science student who likes building things end-to-end: web apps, data/ML experiments, and games.  
I enjoy projects where I can combine **clean UX**, **solid backend logic**, and **interesting problem-solving**.

- 🔭 Currently working on: **Ghostnote** (audio instrument/vocal separation)
- 🧠 Interested in: full-stack engineering, applied ML, and game mechanics/physics
- 🤝 Always down to collaborate on: web apps, hackathon builds, and open-source tools
